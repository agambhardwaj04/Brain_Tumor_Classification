      st.write('A brain tumor is an abnormal growth of cells in the brain. It can be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Brain tumors can cause various symptoms depending on their size and location, including headaches, seizures, and cognitive changes. Even benign tumors can be harmful because they may press against sensitive areas of the brain, affecting its normal function. Malignant tumors are more aggressive, growing quickly and often spreading into surrounding brain tissue. Since the brain controls all bodily activities, even a small tumor can have significant effects depending on where it is located. Brain tumors are diagnosed through imaging techniques such as MRI or CT scans and are often followed by a biopsy to confirm the type. Treatment typically involves a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or targeted drug therapy, depending on the tumor‚Äôs characteristics. Advances in technology and medical research have improved outcomes, especially when tumors are detected early.')

      st.write("""
        Brain tumor detection is a critical process in diagnosing and treating abnormal growths within the brain. It typically involves advanced imaging techniques such as MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) or CT (Computed Tomography) scans, which provide detailed views of the brain‚Äôs structure. Accurate detection is essential for determining the presence, size, location, and type of tumor, all of which influence the treatment plan. In recent years, technology has greatly enhanced the detection process, with artificial intelligence and deep learning models increasingly being used to analyze medical images. These tools help radiologists identify tumors more quickly and accurately, even in early stages, reducing the chances of misdiagnosis. Early and precise detection not only improves treatment outcomes but also increases the chances of survival and recovery for patients.

    with st.expander('How Deep Learning and AI is used in Brain Tumor Detection ?'):
      st.write("""Deep learning, a specialized area  of artificial intelligence (AI), plays a transformative role in brain tumor detection and medical imaging. Unlike traditional methods that rely heavily on manual feature extraction, deep learning uses neural networks‚Äîespecially convolutional neural networks (CNNs)‚Äîto automatically learn and identify complex patterns within medical images such as MRI or CT scans. These models can be trained on thousands of annotated brain scans to distinguish between healthy tissue and tumors, or even to classify tumor types and grades.
      The integration of AI in healthcare offers several key advantages. Deep learning systems can analyze images with remarkable speed and consistency, significantly reducing the time required for diagnosis. They also help minimize human error by detecting subtle abnormalities that might be missed by the human eye. In brain tumor diagnosis, AI assists radiologists by highlighting potential problem areas, ranking tumor severity, and suggesting probable classifications. This augmented intelligence does not replace doctors but supports them in making more accurate, faster, and data-driven decisions.""")
    with st.expander('Benefits of Early Detection of Brain Tumors'):
       st.write('Early detection of brain tumors plays a crucial role in improving patient outcomes and survival rates. Identifying a tumor in its initial stages often allows for more effective and less invasive treatment options, reducing the risk of complications. It can help preserve vital brain functions such as memory, movement, and speech by preventing the tumor from growing or spreading. Early diagnosis also enables timely medical intervention, increases the chances of full recovery, and can significantly lower treatment costs. Overall, early detection empowers both patients and doctors to make informed decisions and plan a personalized care strategy')
